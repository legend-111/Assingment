#13. Run the following lines of code and explain the error in your own words. Then rewrite the lines of code to run error free:
d={'one':1, 'two':2, 'three':3}
print(d['one'])
#errors = frist of all it is dictionary so we have to use 'one','two','three' for defining . for printing the value we have to use print statement 

#14 Run the following lines of code and explain the error in your own words. Then rewrite the lines of code to run error free:
f = 'false' 
not f
# error = boolean expression is defiened as 'false' not false  

# 1. Run the following lines of code and explain the error in your own words. Then rewrite the lines of code to run error free:
st = [1,3,5] 
print(st[1])
#error = there is only 2 indexing [0,1,2] thats why print is not working id you want to print 3 then you have to use [1] and variable is incorect doesnot start with numerical value
